# Berlin Rust Hack and Learn: The NAIVE<sup>*</sup> Sessions

## 2024-03-14: NAIVE<sup>*</sup> session #004 â€“ String concatenation

<sup>*</sup>Novice And Intermediate Vocational Exercises

### Challenge description

We start from the code in src/main.rs:

We want to create and print a variable **pb** of type **PathBuf**. The PathBuf type is imported in line 1 from the standard library. The path **/home/naive/session/session_42/README.txt** has to be constructed **in an OS agnostic way** from the provided variables a to e (the variables must be used, but new derived variables are allowed). We also define another important constraint: the use of the **format!** macro is not allowed anywhere in the code.

This task would be extremely easy to solve in highlevel languages like Javascript, but can become quite complicated in Rust due to type safety constraints - at least for Rust beginners.
